## Background
The world's biodiversity is threatened by multiple factors, making conservation work a challenging prospect:

🖐️ Conservation is challenging at best, exacerbated by climate change and multiple resource demands. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that taxes any organization's capacity.<br>
🖐️ Conservation organizations rarely have the time or capacity to measure success and incorporate learning into their project implementation. Data generation, management, and analysis are increasingly important but challenging.<br>
🖐️ Solutions for geospatial analysis, collaborative leadership, and communications are not geared toward conservation organizations.

## Value Proposition
3point.xyz offers the following solutions to conservation problems:

🎯 Integrated tech with qualitative methods. <br>
🎯 Triangulation of data, learning, and collaboration.<br>
🎯 Cost-effective success measurement and learning.

## Expectations
✨ We’ll have an initial meeting to discuss your needs and outline how to work together to achieve your goals.<br>
✨ We'll tailor a bespoke design to meet your organization and constituency's needs.<br>
✨ Finally, we'll integrate cutting-edge conservation, climate, and behavior change science to design a strategy you can successfully implement and replicate!
